# Platform Design

## Platform - CAD Model

A Computer-Aided Design (CAD) model was developed to create a structured platform. This platform is designed to securely hold five PCBs of identical size, a battery, and a solar panel. The arrangement optimizes space usage and allows easy maintenance and troubleshooting.

## Mounting Provisions

Heat-set inserts are incorporated into the platform design. These are threaded receptacles allowing secure attachment of other components with screws. The six PCBs will be mounted using these inserts, providing sturdy, reusable screw threads that can withstand frequent assembly and disassembly. The solar panel, elevated above the PCBs and battery, will be secured to the platform using a similar method.

## Component 3D CAD Models

### 18650 Battery Cell Model

A 3D CAD model of an 18650 lithium-ion battery cell was created based on the physical specifications (diameter: 18mm, length: 65mm) of a standard 18650 battery cell.

### Solar Panel Model

A basic block model for the Voltaic P108 solar panel was created, accurately reflecting its exact dimensions.

## Integration of Components onto the Platform

### Importing the 5V USB Charger Board Model

The 3D STEP model of the 5V USB charger board was imported into the assembly. The model accurately represents the physical dimensions, form, and connectors of the charger board.

### Charger Board Placement

The 5V USB charger board was incorporated into the existing platform model. The CAD model shows the board's position, ensuring proper securement and accessibility for charging purposes.

#### Retaining Features

To secure the charger PCB, retaining features like slots, pillars, and clips were added to the design. Simple solutions like tape, hot glue, or drilled-holes with screws were deemed insufficient.

### Importing the MPPT Converter Board Model

The 3D STEP model of the completed MPPT converter board was imported into the assembly. The CAD model represents the board with all components populated and signal traces connected.

### MPPT Converter Board Placement

The MPPT converter board was incorporated into the existing platform model. The CAD model illustrates the board's position, ensuring proper securement and accessibility for connection to the solar panels.

#### Retaining Features

Retaining features were added to secure the MPPT converter board on the platform. As with the charger board, tape, hot glue, or drilled-holes with screws were not considered sufficient.

## Solar Panel Connection

A detailed description of how the solar panels will connect to the MPPT converter board was prepared, including a description of the connectors, wires, and routes used for the connections.

## Serviceability

The overall mechanical system is designed to be serviceable, meaning that the PCBs and other components can be easily removed from the platform for maintenance or replacement. Additionally, the platform can be easily opened to access the electronics inside.
