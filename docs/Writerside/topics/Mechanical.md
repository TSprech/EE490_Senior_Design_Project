# Senior Design Project: Platform for PCB Mounting
## Platform - CAD Model
We used Autodesk Inventor to design a platform for our project. The primary function of this platform is to hold our series of PCBs. Additionally, we incorporated provisions to mount a solar panel.

## Platform Specifications
### Platform Size
The platform has dimensions of ***** x ***** x *****. These dimensions were chosen to ensure adequate space for all the project-specific PCBs, the solar panel, and the instructor's PCB.

### Platform Material
The platform is manufactured using 3D printing. The specific material used for this purpose is *****.

### Mounting Provisions
For mounting components securely, we opted for 3mm heat set inserts. These provide anchorage for the PCBs and the solar panel. It's worth noting that the solar panel is designed to be positioned above the PCBs to prevent any obstructions.

## Components
A 18650 battery cell.
The Volatic Systems 9 watt, 18 volt, P108 solar panel. This panel measures 221mm x 257mm x 5mm.
### Additional Components
We've also integrated a 5V USB charger board into our assembly. The design of our platform eliminated the need for a rectangular cutout for this component.
